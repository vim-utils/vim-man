*man.txt*	View man pages in vim. Grep for the man pages.

Maintainer: Bruno Sutic <https://www.github.com/bruno->

INTRODUCTION					*man* *vim-man*

This plugin enables viewing and navigating manual pages in vim.
|:Mangrep| command adds the possibility of grepping all the manpages.

COMMANDS					*man-commands*

						*man-:Man_command*
:Man [args]		Open man page in a horizontal split. The command has
			support for man page completion.
			Examples:
				:Man printf
				:Man 3 sprintf

			When editing 'nroff' files, this command can be invoked
			without arguments to open current file as a man page.

						*man-:Sman*
:Sman [args]		The same as |:Man_command|.

						*man-:Vman*
:Vman [args]		Like |:Man_command|, but open man page in a vertical
			split.

						*man-:Mangrep*
:Mangrep[!] [args]	Grep the content of manual pages. This feature is
			still in "beta". Results should be accurate, but you
			might experience hiccups when opening results from the
			quickfix list. Also please see |:Mangrep_strategy|.
			Example:
				:Mangrep 1 foobar

			If man page section number is not provided it will
			default to 1. So this command:
				:Mangrep foobar

			is equivalent to this one:
				:Mangrep 1 foobar

			The section defaults to 1 because searching all
			sections takes a long time. If you want to force
			searching all man sections, use *:
				:Mangrep * foobar

			Start a case insensitive search with the '-i' flag:
				:Mangrep -i 6 foobar

			Regex searches are possible too (the same as
			with 'grep -E') but remember to quote the search
			pattern:
				:Mangrep 6 'foo(bar|baz)'

						*man-:Mangrep_strategy*
			If you use neovim, |:Mangrep| command runs
			asynchronously in the background.

			If you have vim-dispatch plugin installed |:Mangrep|
			command also runs in the background. Access the
			results with :Copen command (may be called before
                        the process is finished).

			With vanilla vim |:Mangrep| will block and make vim
			unusable until the command is done (and it can take a
			while). Installing vim-dispatch plugin is recommended,
			but if that is not possible consider running
			|:Mangrep| in another vim. That way your working vim instance
			stays usable.

MAN						*ft-man*

The following mappings are defined when displaying a man page:

						*man-]]*
]]			Jump to the next section heading.

						*man-[[*
[[			Jump to the previous section heading.

						*man-CTRL-]* *man-g_CTRL-]*
						*man-g]* *man-CTRL-W_CTRL-]*
						*man-CTRL-W_]* *man-CTRL-W_g}*
						*man-CTRL-W_g_CTRL-]*
						*man-CTRL-W_g]* *man-CTRL-W_}*
CTRL-]			Jump to man page for a word under cursor (all the
			mappings behave the same).

						*man-K*
K			Same as |man-CTRL-]|.

						*man-CTRL-T*
CTRL-T			Jump back to the previous man page.

						*man-g/* *g/*
g/			Start option search.

MAPS						*man-maps*

No global mappings are defined by default, but you can define the following
in your |vimrc|:

- open man page for a word under cursor in a horizontal split
>
  map <leader>k <Plug>(Man)
<
- open man page for a word under cursor in a vertical split
>
  map <leader>v <Plug>(Vman)
<
OPTIONS						*man-options*

Default man command is '/usr/bin/man', but it can be changed:
>
  let g:vim_man_cmd = 'LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 /usr/bin/man'
<


man_split_type                          *g:man_split_type*
Change the default split type when using |:Man|. Valid values are
'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'tab'

>
  let g:man_split_type = 'horizontal'
<
